# Sudoku-app-with-GUI-and-all
A GUI for actually solving the Sudoku puzzles generated by the Sudoku generator program from the https://github.com/SamLokh/Sudoku-Puzzle-Generator repository (v2.2). It takes a puzzle from the MultiplePuzzles.txt.

Just edit the paths accordingly.

You can comment the part with the Flag.txt file, thats related to another program.
